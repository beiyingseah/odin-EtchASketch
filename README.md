# odin-EtchASketch

This is my fourth project for The Odin Project, where I apply my DOM manipulation skills (the very first time was for Project 3: implementing a basic UI for Rock, Paper, Scissors) alongside CSS and HTML to create something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

TODOs Part 1: HTML

- Create a container to hold the 16x16 square divs
- Add footer to stamp creator info: "built by Bei Ying Seah"
- Add a 'Classic' button: that changes colour of a square from white to grey to black, i.e. each hover adds another 10% of black (opacity) to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
- Add a 'Rainbow' button
- Add a 'Clear' button
- Add a 'Grid Size' slider: Add a sliding scale option: from 1x1 to 64x64 (total space remains constant e.g. 960px(pixels) wide)

Part 2: CSS
- Add a Favicon to your app's tab (;
- Style the container into a flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid instead of a straight line, set the borders and margins

Part 3: Javascript - the UI Fundamentals
- Create the 16x 16 square divs
- Create a dynamic grid that changes based on user input
- Set up a "hover" effect: grid divs change colour when browser registers a 'hover' event (addEventListener() to mark when mouse enters a div and leaves it): (i) add new class to the div OR (ii) change the div's background colour with JavaScript

JS File: Helper functions -> Functionalities
- Clear
- Erase
- Grid set-up
- Grid Size control: automatically clears/reset upon change
- Grey Scale mode: progressively black by 10% till square turns black after 10 'mouseovers'
- Rainbow mode

EXTRA CREDIT
- CSS enhancements to 'Etch-a-sketch' font, game console (adding of shadows to create 3D-effect) and buttons to make it look more realistic (skeuomorphic)

p.s. This project was birthed at the cusp of the start of 2022!! My final commit was pushed on 1 Jan 2022, just as the clock struck 12. And who else to accompany me but my most steadfast companion, Sprouty. I'm finally done with this project for now - happy 2022!!! (:
