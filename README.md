# odin-EtchASketch

This is my fourth project for The Odin Project, where I apply my DOM manipulation skills (the very first time was for Project 3: implementing a basic UI for Rock, Paper, Scissors) to create something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

TODOs
Part 1: HTML
- Create a container to hold the 16x16 square divs 
- Add footer to stamp creator info: "build by Bei Ying Seah"
- Add a 'Classic' button: that changes colour of a square from white to grey to black, i.e. each hover adds another 10% of black  (opacity) to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
- Add a 'Pick your colour' button
- Add a 'Rainbow' button
- Add a 'Clear' button
- Add a 'Grid Size' slider: Add a sliding scale option: from 1x1 to 64x64 (total space remains constant e.g. 960px(pixels) wide)


Part 2: CSS
- Style the container into a flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid instead of a straight line, set the borders and margins


Part 3: Javascript - the UI
Fundamentals
- Create the 16x 16 square divs
- Set up a "hover" effect: grid divs change colour when browser registers a 'hover' event (addEventListener() to mark when mouse enters a div and leaves it): (i) add new class to the div OR (ii) change the div's background colour with JavaScript

Functionalities
- Clear:
- Erase:
- Change Grid Size: automatically clears/reset upon change
-
